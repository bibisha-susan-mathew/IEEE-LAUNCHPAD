# BIBISHA SUSAN MATHEW

### About Me
Hello, I'm Bibisha Susan Mathew, a fresh graduate in B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. With a passion for technology and a keen interest in AI, I'm eager to explore the endless possibilities it offers to transform industries and improve lives. In the realm of programming, I bring proficiency in Python, C, HTML, and CSS. My journey in software and web development began with an enriching internship experience at Sysbreeze Technologies, Calicut, where I honed my skills and gained practical insights into building dynamic web applications. Driven by a desire to apply AI in healthcare, I undertook notable projects during my academic journey. One such project involved developing a system for depression detection using sentiment analysis techniques. Additionally, I led a team in our main project focused on utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification of chest diseases, aiming to assist healthcare professionals in accurate diagnosis. Beyond academics, I actively engage in various extracurricular activities. I serve as a member of the National Service Scheme (NSS) and have taken on leadership roles as a class representative and as the lead of the AI club. These experiences have not only enriched my interpersonal skills but also instilled in me a sense of responsibility towards community engagement and social impact
